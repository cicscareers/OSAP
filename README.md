# UMass CICS Open-Source Apprenticeship Program (OSAP)

The **UMass CICS Open-Source Apprenticeship Program (OSAP)** aims to bridge the skill gap between theoretical classroom foundations and real-world software development by applying the [apprenticeship model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apprenticeship) (used in fields like medicine, plumbing, automotive, etc.) to the discipline of software engineering, Students will build transferrable technical and professional skills through hands-on experience contributing to established open-source projects with direct guidance from industry mentors.

The program aligns directly with the College’s vision of **"Computing for the Common Good"** by helping students become active contributors to the [Software Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_commons_(economics)).

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Program

**Who is sponsoring the open source program?**

The open source program is an initiative led by [CICS Careers](https://www.cics.umass.edu/careers) with the help of outside industry advisors and mentors for the purpose of helping students to be better prepared for careers in computer science.

**What benefit will I get out of the program?**

At the completion of the program, it is anticipated that you’ll have gained substantial knowledge in real world software development by learning the dynamics of an open source project.  This includes both hard skills (e.g., source control) and soft skills (e.g., communication with your project’s leadership).

**Is there anything that I can put on my resume at the end of the program?**

In addition to the valuable experience that you will have gained, we will provide successful students with a certificate that indicates "Completion of CICS Careers Open Source Summer 2025 Program."

**How do I apply for the program?**

The application is short and intended to best match the mentee with a mentor.  We will shortly update this section with a link.

**How can I find out who my mentor is and the mentor’s contact info?**

Mentor/Mentee assignments will be posted soon.

**If I’m having challenges with the program, such as connecting with my mentor/mentee, selecting an open source project, etc., who can I contact?**

**I have an idea for a new open source project. Can I do that as part of this program?**

This program is focused around existing open source projects to give students the experience of working within an open source community.  Ideally, the student should see how industry works on open source projects, ranging from requirements, design, unit testing, and getting code accepted by project leadership.
