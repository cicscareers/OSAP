# UMass CICS Open-Source Apprenticeship Program (OSAP)

The **UMass CICS Open-Source Apprenticeship Program (OSAP)** aims to bridge the skill gap between theoretical classroom foundations and real-world software development by applying the [apprenticeship model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apprenticeship) (used in fields like medicine, plumbing, automotive, etc.) to the discipline of software engineering, Students will build transferrable technical and professional skills through hands-on experience contributing to established open-source projects with direct guidance from industry mentors.

The program aligns directly with the Collegeâ€™s vision of **"Computing for the Common Good"** by helping students become active contributors to the [Software Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_commons_(economics)).
