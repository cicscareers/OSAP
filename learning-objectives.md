# Learning Objectives

Included below is a week-by-week breakdown for mentors participating in the OSAP program. Key skill-building milestones and deliverables for mentees are enumerated.

**Bloom’s Taxonomy**: All Learning Objectives roughly follow Bloom’s Taxonomy. The model of the program is to teach the theory (Understand) in an asynchronous style, followed by a “practical” (Apply) portion where the theory is applied to a real open-source project with the guidance of a mentor.

## Week 1: Picking a Project

By the end of week 1, mentees should feel motivated and empowered to contribute to an open-source project of their interest. Mentees will be provided with a high-level overview of the open-source ecosystem and why it matters. Special attention should be paid to the critical importance of having a diverse set of contributors and contributions for a healthy ecosystem. Mentees should have a clear understanding of the ethics of open-source software development. Mentors should ensure that projects and contributions are appropriately “sized” (e.g. issues labelled with “good-first-issue”) depending on academic coursework, personal interests, and community governance/health. Mentees should select a project + contribution combination that motivates them and targets key technical and professional skills that they would like to build through the program. Communities with existing mentor involvement (e.g. [arrow.apache.org](http://arrow.apache.org)) may be more desirable should technical or communication challenges arise during the program.

**Theory:**

- [ ] Remember the program (OSAP) expectations (communicated via application process)
- [ ] Remember basic open-source terminology (e.g. code forge, repo, commit, PR, fork, etc.)
- [ ] Understand what open-source is and is NOT
- [ ] Understand the different kinds of open-source contributions (code, doc, art, etc.)
- [ ] Understand basic open-source legal concepts (licenses, CLAs, etc.)
- [ ] Understand basic open-source governance concepts
- [ ] Understand how to find projects of interest (GitHub Topics, trending, etc.)

**Practice:**

- [ ] Apply Code Forge discovery techniques to find projects of interest
- [ ] Evaluate potential open-source projects of interest based on license, governance, and activity
- [ ] Evaluate existing open project issues for potential contribution opportunities

**Deliverables:**

- [ ] Create a list of potential project contributions

## Week 2: Version Control (Git) Fundamentals

By the end of week 2, mentees should feel confident with version control (i.e., Git) fundamentals. They should be able to clone, modify, and commit new code to an existing codebase. They should understand how version control systems facilitate distributed collaboration through online Code Forges, like GitHub and GitLab. This week establishes the technical foundation for student engagement with open-source communities, so extra time should be spent as needed to address any technical questions from mentees.

**Theory:**

- [ ] Understand what version control is
- [ ] Understand what the “distributed” means in distributed version control systems
- [ ] Understand what a “Code Forge” is (GitHub, GitLab, Codeberg, etc.)
- [ ] Understand how to commit code
- [ ] Understand how to push code
- [ ] Understand how to merge and rebase code
- [ ] Understand best practices for writing commit descriptions
- [ ] Understand best practices for creating project issues
- [ ] Understand best practices for creating pull requests

**Practice:**

- [ ] Analyze selected project commits for focus, description, code quality
- [ ] Analyze selected project issues and pull requests for focus, description, code quality
- [ ] Create a local Git configuration (SSH keys, username, email, etc.)
- [ ] Create a local git clone of selected project repository
- [ ] Create a local git clone of the OSAP GitHub repository
- [ ] Create a pull request to the OSAP GitHub repository

**Deliverables:**

- [ ] Configure git + Code Forge account
- [ ] Clone selected project repo
- [ ] Make a pull request to OSAP repo
- [ ] Select a project contribution
- [ ] Review any Contribution Guides for selected project

## Week 3: Building the Code

By the end of week 3, mentees should understand what a build system is and have gained hands-on experience building a new codebase from scratch. They should feel comfortable editing the existing code and seeing changes reflected in the software after building.  For mentees, this is a critical first step into the technical side of open-source. Mentors should anticipate technical questions from mentees and do their best to make themselves extra available this week.

**Theory:**

- [ ] Understand what a build system is
- [ ] Understand what a build artifact is
- [ ] Understand what build dependencies are
- [ ] Understand the concept of incremental builds
- [ ] Understand how to set up project-specific development tools

**Practice:**

- [ ] Apply knowledge of build systems to build project code
- [ ] Analyze any build failures
- [ ] Analyze requirements for selected project contribution
- [ ] Create a local development environment and set up project-specific development tools

**Deliverables:**

- [ ] Build the project code successfully
- [ ] Make a change to the project and build again
- [ ] Identify list of requirements for contribution

## Weeks 4-8: Modifying the Code

By the end of week 8, mentees should have implemented a meaningful contribution for their selected project. Throughout the development process, special attention should be paid to encouraging good software development practices and building real-world technical skills (e.g. unit testing, design patterns, performance profiling, code commenting, documentation, code-reuse, object-oriented programming, functional programming, etc.). Mentors should be prepared to provide hands-on technical guidance as appropriate.

**Theory:**

- [ ] Understand strategies for exploring code bases (grep, types, tests, etc.)
- [ ] Understand the importance of debuggers/debugging
- [ ] Understand best practices for testing
- [ ] Understand best practices for documentation and code comments
- [ ] Understand the importance of high quality code

**Practice:**

- [ ] Apply code search techniques to identify areas of code that need to be modified (if applicable)
- [ ] Apply testing best practices (if applicable)
- [ ] Apply documentation best practices (if applicable)
- [ ] Analyze existing code and bugs using debugging techniques (if applicable)

**Deliverables:**

- [ ] Write code for contribution
- [ ] Write tests for contribution
- [ ] Write documentation for contribution
- [ ] Perform a preliminary code review with mentor

## Week 9: Your First Contribution

By the end of week 9, mentees should have gained hands-on experience making an upstream pull request to their selected project. Special attention should be paid to writing high quality pull request descriptions, as well as addressing any CI/CD failures. Any legal requirements - e.g. Contributor License Agreement (CLA) signing - will need to be addressed prior to making an upstream pull request. Mentors should be prepared to assist mentees in addressing all forms of feedback from the community.

This doesn’t necessarily mean a mentee’s first contribution only happens at Week 9. Some students may first decide to go for a smaller change, for example documentation updates, that can be done in a week itself. Some groups / mentee’s may prefer a smaller feedback loop and end up attempting multiple issues as part of this program using this strategy. The contents of Week 9 should still serve as a guideline for the PR and merge process for all mentors.

**Theory:**

- [ ] Remember best practices for writing issues / pull request descriptions
- [ ] Understand code review best practices
- [ ] Understand continuous integration / delivery (CI/CD) workflows
- [ ] Understand common markup formats (e.g. Markdown)
- [ ] Understand the importance of clear communication in online spaces

**Practice:**

- [ ] Analyze CI/CD failures
- [ ] Create an upstream pull request

**Deliverables:**

- [ ] Create an upstream pull request
- [ ] Address CI/CD failures
- [ ] Address community feedback

## Week 10: Wrap Up

By the end of week 10, mentees should feel excited and empowered to continue their open-source journey into the future. They should feel accomplished in having made a “real” contribution to a “production-ready” codebase and gained valuable, hands-on software engineering skills along the way that will help to propel them in the future - whether they pursue careers in academia, industry, or elsewhere. Mentors should set expectations for future communication with mentees outside the scope of the “formal” program timeline. Feedback will be collected from mentees using the Undergraduate Research Volunteers (URV) post assessment.

**Theory:**

- [ ] Understand career possibilities in open-source
- [ ] Understand how to get help when stuck beyond the scope of the program (mailing lists, etc.)

**Practice:**

- [ ] Apply code review best practices to address remaining community feedback

**Deliverables:**

- [ ] Merged contribution (if applicable - dependent on contribution complexity + governance)
